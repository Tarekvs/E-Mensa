# E-Mensa

E-Mensa is a web application that provides an interactive platform for a virtual Cafeteria and its meals. This repository contains the source code and documentation for E-Mensa.

## Overview

E-Mensa was built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept. The core routing script, `index.php`, was not written by me but serves as the foundational structure for the application. However, I have implemented all controllers, views, SQL database connections, database logic, and a logger to extend and enhance the functionality of the website.

## Features

E-Mensa offers a wide range of features, including:

- **Database Interaction**: The website is capable of creating a database connection, fetching data from the database, adding new records to the database, and deleting existing records.

- **Database Security**:To protect against SQL injection attacks, user inputs are sanitized before they are used in SQL queries. This is achieved using the mysqli_real_escape_string() function, which escapes special characters in a string for use in an SQL statement.

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in with a username, password, and email. The password is hashed before being saved in the Database. Furthermore admin privileges are available for users that register as admins.

- **Meal Reviews**: Logged-in users can review meals and share their opinions. Admins can delete reviews.

- **Profile Management**: Users have access to their profiles, where they can edit their information and view their activity.

- **Statistical Data**: The website provides statistical data regarding its usage and user interactions.

- **Meal Recommendations**: Users can recommend new meals for inclusion in the system, contributing to the variety of available options.

- **Newsletter Signup**: Users can subscribe to a newsletter.

- **User Reviews**: Users can read and engage with reviews submitted by other users.

- **Logging**: The website also contains a live logger to record important events and actions for debugging and monitoring purposes.
